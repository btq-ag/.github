# BTQ Technologies

Post-quantum cryptography infrastructure. We build hardware, signature schemes, ZK tooling, and blockchain protocols designed to withstand quantum attacks.

## Projects

**[Keelung](https://github.com/btq-ag/keelung)** · Haskell DSL for zero-knowledge proofs. Compiles to R1CS for Aurora/PLONK backends. See also [keelung-compiler](https://github.com/btq-ag/keelung-compiler).

**[Preon](https://btq.com/preon)** · zk-SNARK signature scheme, NIST PQC candidate. Hash-based security (no lattice assumptions), small keys, threshold signing support.

**[btq-core](https://github.com/btq-ag/btq-core)** · Bitcoin-derived testnet with ML-DSA signatures. Migration testbed for post-quantum UTXO systems.

**QCIM** · Processing-in-memory cryptographic accelerator for constrained environments. Sub-microjoule operations, crypto-agile design.

**[Leonne](https://github.com/btq-ag/leonne)** · Modular consensus with topological protection.

**[QRiNG](https://github.com/btq-ag/qring)** · Quantum random number generation for consensus entropy.
